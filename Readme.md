# Calculator

This will be a calculator project which will be version controlled as we progress through our course.

This calculator as of now (v4.05) has a main menue where options for single or multiple number operations can be done and also exit button is present here. Nn-gui program.

## GOALS:

1. Add **basic features** with integers and floats such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Remark**: Featurs such as add, sub, mult and div added. At present, the application reads the calculator version gives out results with predetermined values set by the coder and ends. Division gives out float value which is then converted into an int value which can be altered later.

2. Make the program **interactive**, where the program asks for user input. Cpompleted

- **Remark**: The Program is dynamic. Program asks for the operation mentioned in the list by showing the list and then asks for two numbers. Then it performs the used defined operation with the user-defined numbers. (v2.01)

3. Make the program **crashproof**. Completed.

- **Remark**: The program doesn't take anything else when asking for a number. This was done with a while true loop asking user repeatedly for the correct type of input i.e., int or floats.

4. Make the program **modular** using **functions**. Completed.

- **Remark:** The program is modulerised with three main functions. One checks the input for errors (num_check func), second keeps the calculator logic (cal_logic function), and the third adds a main menue block which lets the user exit out of the calculator program. (v4.02)

**Note:** Goal 3, and 4 are compacted together for the ease of understanding.

5. Add other advanced functions such as trigonometric, statistical functions available to the user in the program.

- **Remark**: Logarithm and power added (v2.02). Perm and Comb added (v4.03). Trig functions added. Factorial, Gamma function Added. (v4.04)

6. Add gui to the program.
7. Make a full deployable web/smartphone/desktop application out of the
program.

**Advanced functionality** that aren't available to the conventional calculators
but are supposed to be intigrated in this calculator:
1. Average function: User will input various values (integer, float) separated by comma, and the calculator will find the average.

> - **v4.04:** Single entity functions such as trig (sin, cos , factorial etc. added.
> - **v4.05:** Format and list comprehensions are introduced to the code format.
